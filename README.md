# Gladys SmartThings integration

External [Gladys Assistant](https://gladysassistant.com) integration for
**Samsung SmartThings**: control your SmartThings switches, lights, locks,
motorized shades, thermostats and sensors from Gladys.

It runs as a standalone Docker container and talks to Gladys through the
[`@gladysassistant/integration-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gladysassistant/integration-sdk),
and to Samsung through the [SmartThings Cloud API](https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/api/public)
using a **Personal Access Token**.

## References

The capability mapping and API usage were verified against:

- the SmartThings OpenAPI (Swagger) spec: <https://swagger.api.smartthings.com/public/st-api.yml>
- the SmartThings public API reference: <https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/api/public>
- the official Home Assistant SmartThings integration
  ([`homeassistant/components/smartthings`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/smartthings))
  and its [`pysmartthings`](https://github.com/pySmartThings/pysmartthings) library
- a live SmartThings account (real `GET /devices` and `/status` payloads), which
  is what surfaced the Samsung `powerConsumptionReport` nested-object shape.

## Configuration

The integration needs a single secret: a SmartThings **Personal Access Token**
generated at <https://account.smartthings.com/tokens> with the _Devices_ (list,
see, control) and _Locations_ (see) scopes.

> ⚠️ New SmartThings PATs expire after 24 hours (policy change of late 2024).

See [`docs/en.md`](docs/en.md) / [`docs/fr.md`](docs/fr.md) for the full user
documentation.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test          # node:test unit tests + e2e (boots index.js against fakes)
npm run lint
npm run format
```

The end-to-end test (`test/e2e.test.js`) boots the real `index.js` against a
fake Gladys host (WebSocket + REST) and a fake SmartThings API, exercising
discovery, poll and set-value.
